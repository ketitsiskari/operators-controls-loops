# Operators and Controls. Loops 

## Tasks

### Arrays difference
Create javascript function to find difference between two arrays.
For example:
```js
arrayDiff([1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) // [4, 5]
arrayDiff(['a', 'b', 'c'], ['a', 'b']) // ['c']
```

### Even Odd checker
Write function which gets to numbers and iterates over them and check is it even or odd.
For example:
```js
evenOrOdd(0, 3); // ['0 is even', '1 is odd', '2 is even', '3 is odd']
evenOrOdd(2, 4); // ['2 is even', '3 is odd', '4 is even']
```

### Range sum
Write function to get sum of all numbers in given range.

For example:
```js
rangeSum(5, 10); // 45
rangeSum(0, 6); // 21 
```

Write your code in `src/index.js.
*All test cases are designed as “error-free”, so don't worry about handling any errors.*
